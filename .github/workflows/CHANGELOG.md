### Fixed: npm Cache Dependency Path Error (2025-10-31)

**Issue:**
Workflow was failing with error:
```
Some specified paths were not resolved, unable to cache dependencies.
```

**Root Cause:**
The `setup-node@v4` action's `cache-dependency-path` option requires `package-lock.json` files to exist. When these files don't exist or aren't committed, the caching step fails and can cause the workflow to fail.

**Solution:**
1. Removed `cache-dependency-path` from `setup-node` actions
2. Added explicit `actions/cache@v3` steps for both backend and frontend
3. Added `continue-on-error: true` to cache steps to prevent failures
4. Updated dependency installation to handle missing lock files gracefully:
   - Uses `npm ci` if `package-lock.json` exists
   - Falls back to `npm install` if lock file doesn't exist
   - Skips installation if `package.json` doesn't exist

**Files Changed:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
  - `ci-tests` job: Updated caching and dependency installation
  - `deploy-function-app` job: Updated caching and dependency installation

**Benefits:**
- Workflow now works whether or not lock files exist
- Faster builds when cache is available
- More resilient to missing files
- Better error messages

## Workflow Improvements

### Caching Strategy

**Before:**
- Single cache configuration tied to `setup-node`
- Failed if lock files missing
- No fallback mechanism

**After:**
- Separate cache steps for backend and frontend
- Graceful handling of missing files
- Fallback to `npm install` when needed
- Cache persists across workflow runs

### Dependency Installation

**Before:**
```yaml
cache: 'npm'
cache-dependency-path: |
  backend/package-lock.json
  frontend/package-lock.json
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Cache backend node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  continue-on-error: true
  with:
    path: backend/node_modules
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-backend-node-${{ hashFiles('backend/package-lock.json') }}
```

### Error Handling

- Added `continue-on-error: true` to cache steps
- Added file existence checks before installation
- Improved error messages for debugging

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defensive Programming**: Check for file existence before operations
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Workflow continues even if caching fails
3. **Consistent Patterns**: Same caching approach across all jobs
4. **Clear Error Messages**: Helpful messages when files are missing

## Recommendations

### For Repository Maintainers

1. **Commit Lock Files**: For consistent builds, commit `package-lock.json` files:
   ```bash
   git add backend/package-lock.json frontend/package-lock.json
   git commit -m "Add package lock files"
   ```

2. **Update Dependencies Regularly**: Keep dependencies up to date:
   ```bash
   npm update
   ```

3. **Monitor Cache Hit Rate**: Check workflow logs for cache effectiveness

### For Developers

1. **Run Locally First**: Test changes locally before pushing
2. **Check Workflow Logs**: Review logs if workflow fails
3. **Update Lock Files**: Run `npm install` and commit lock files after dependency changes

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
- [ ] Matrix builds for multiple Node.js versions
- [ ] Parallel test execution
- [ ] Artifact uploads for test results
- [ ] Notification on workflow failures
- [ ] Performance metrics tracking
